# image-mRNA-prognostic-model
This project builds a lasso-regularized Cox proportional hazards model to predict the prognosis using a combination of image features extracted from H&E whole-slide tissue images and gene expression profiles. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated in a large cohort of 410 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas.⋅⋅ Patients' risk indices generated by our model are strongly associated with survival. Log-rank test p value for low- and high-risk patient stratification is 8.79e-10.

The codes in this progject will reproduce the results in our paper submitted to Cancer Research, "Integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data for predicting clear cell renal cell carcinoma prognosis". Our codes were implemented and tested using win10, matlab/2015b, and R 3.3.1.
